**About**

Layla Pizarro is a Multifaceted Artist based in Chile. Her practice bridges two distinct realms: figurative realism and non-representational abstraction. Her works are a reflection of her days and her experiences. Her artistic practice ranges from analog and digital painting to digital and experimental photography. In her latest work, she uses GAN training as a tool to generate images for further exploration through digital and analog mediums. 
 
She is creator and co-host of Arte y Labia, a weekly podcast where, together with B√°rbara Quiroga, they interview Chilean and international Spanish-speaking artists. She also co-hosts SOBRE ARTE on Twitter Spaces, a space dedicated to discussing artistic influences with co-host Cristian Arregium and different guest artists, with the goal of connecting NFTs to the history of art.
 
She began artistic studies in Union City, New Jersey, at the age of 15 attending a high school with an artistic focus. During the summer holidays, she participated in programs for young artists at Montclair State University and Rutgers University focusing on oil painting and sculpture.
 
She traveled to Israel as part of an interdisciplinary art program where she spent a month traveling the country performing artistic interventions. She studied Visual Arts and Anthropology at Rutgers University. She continued her artistic studies at New Jersey City University. Layla decided to pause her studies to start her family.
 
During the following years she continued to develop as an artist through courses and workshops. Layla developed several emblematic works in these workshops such as the series, ""Conmigo"" and ""Distancia"", both in ink and an artist‚Äôs book ‚ÄúEl maiz es el sol y el sol es oro‚Äù
 
Layla has exhibited physically in Santiago de Chile, Hong Kong and NYC and Dubai. Digitially, she has exhibited in the metaverse as part of group shows in Decentraland, Cryptovoxels and Oncyber. Her works have been in the Stratosphere NFT exhibition in Beijing and SearchLight exhibition as part of NFT NYC Conference 2021.

**About**

I am a photographer who believes that good can be achieved through art. That is why my first sales have been donated to charity and why I have created the Influential Women Charity Collection in a collab with my Mother In Law to support women in need. Looking forward I am going to create mixed collections, some focused on charity, some not, but this doesn't mean that my number one focus won't be supporting those in need.

**About**

I am no artist just an information lover. I share information freely to foster intellectual growth for as many people as I can for as long as I can remember. My involvements in BTC, ETH and LIT are all just extensions of this mission statement. I do it for myself as much as for others sake. I purposefully leave it quietly unmonetized so that those who cross my path may find it useful in the hopes that they may be more inclined to curiously ask questions that, otherwise, seemed unapproachable. P.S. I also plan to release essays explaining my comics and make them relatable and informational with a bit of humor to keep people engaged. Though I often drew comics when in class, my inspiration for these comical drawings stems from the use of similar comics in the writings of Bitcoin developer and teacher Jimmy Song who has been helping Bitcoiners build their own bitcoin libraries for many years.
