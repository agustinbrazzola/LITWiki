**About**

Finding beauty and happiness in my garden. I created this collection with the hope that I could bring back the spark I felt when I developed my first print in photography class. At the time, I wanted to continue on and become an artist. Life’s realities got the best of me and I never fulfilled that dream. Releasing this project is scary as I don’t consider myself a professional photographer. However, I told myself if others believed I had some sort of raw talent, I would move forward with taking more classes and investing in myself as a true photographer and artist. Thank you for your interest and welcome to my garden. I have always preferred black and white photos as they are a window to a new perspective on the world, one that favors texture and light, one that is raw and one that feels less able to be faked to me. I’ve also created a collection of my daughters artwork which I add to periodically when she makes something incredible.

**About**

Name is Paul Warren. Based in Long Island New York I began photography at a young age with 35mm film. Learning in a tiny little darkroom in my highschool I fell in love with the thought of creating and producing imagery. Fast forward to my second year in college I was introduced to digital and the likes of film photographers like Jerry Uelsmaan and Doug Prince. They both used multiple enlargers to create composite film work. I really enjoyed that idea and started to use digital to create my own composites. From there I began to develop my own style over the years. Coming into the love of creating realistic fantasy like imagery as well as emotional driven concepts. 
Now I create to fuel my own heart. To bring the world I wish to see to me. To escape reality, to pass time and pain. 
My Swords and Dragons series itches my need to tell stories and live in a fantasy like world while Digital Daydreams caters to my love of the emotions and whimsical thoughts.

**About**

I am a Photographer, World Traveler, Pilot and Family Man, who captures light to freeze moments in time. Originally meant to help me remember the many beautiful or monumental moments in my history, the advent of NFTs presented me the ability to share my work with the world and a stage I never had access too. While my work spans across Landscapes, Seascapes, and Travel Photography, my photo documentary of a Blackhawk Pilot my most unique addition to the 1/1 NFT space.

**About**

I am a wildlife and landscape photographer living in Honolulu, Hawaii. For almost twenty
years, I have explored my island home to document amazing wildlife, scenic landscapes, volcanic eruptions, and powerful waves.

I feel like I’ve had a camera in my hand my whole life, from my mother’s hand-me-down
Minolta 110 when I was 5 or 6 to an Advantix camera as a graduation gift. I purchased my
first 35mm from Samy’s Camera when I lived in L.A. and my first DSLR in 2009 in Hawaii.
The last ten years have allowed me to share my work in galleries across the islands, being
recognized by international publications, and now my journey into NFTs.

I volunteer with several non-profits focused on education, conservation, and outreach for
Hawaii’s endangered wildlife only found in the Hawaiian islands. Part of the proceeds of
my NFT sales will continue to support those non-profits to ensure that these species are
around for future generations to experience for themselves.

My work has been recognized by National Geographic YourShot, Outdoor Photographer, Hawaii Magazine, Digital Photo, American Photo, the Los Angeles Times, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, PhotoCon Hawaii, and Turtle Bay Resort.

**About**

Water is all around us all the time.  It flows and splashes in spectacular ways, but we cannot see the amazing details without some help.  Liquidity Art uses high speed photography techniques to show what happens when liquids move and impact, close up.

This is a project born of rain.  At the core of the project is the photographer's fascination with the minutiae of nature. In the studio, using ultra-precise timing devices and high tech photographic equipment, the forces of nature on a miniature scale are studied and exposed.
 
Imagine a single drop of water leaving a faucet.  Picture it in slow motion, although it falls quickly and picks up speed.  It passes through an infrared sensor, which triggers a machine that measures time in microseconds.  It hurtles towards its target, which could be a small puddle of water, a glass of water or a dry surface.  It might pass through a soap bubble on its way.
 
The moment of impact, give or take a few milliseconds, is captured.  Time is frozen.  The splendors of nature reveal themselves.  Like snowflakes, no two drops impact alike.  And depending on the surface, the lighting, the background and the perspective, the results can be dramatically different.
