**About**

Clete is a baby artist, a teenage spirit, an adult linguist and an elder story-teller in one mind with so much creativity, passion and enthusiasm and with a goal of creating synesthesia with words and images. She is a dreamer and a builder of the future and a strong believer of the fact that achieving futuristic success is only possible with true human minds.

**About**

I am a painter gone digital with a penchant for the surreal. I love mixing beauty with elemets that are confronting and make you think. Art is a medium to tell a story and affect change.

**About**

GM! I'm a self-taught artist who works in many different media, including photography, painting, drawing, ceramic sculpture, sewing/textiles, set design & installation art. I'm still relatively new to Web3, but planning to start making some NFT collections in the next few months. 

Art to me is about communicating or evoking a feeling that can't be conveyed with ordinary language. I believe it is fluid and alive, like nature- it can mean different things  to different observers from varying perspectives, and the meaning can change over time to reflect new shades of reality.

**About**

Hello! I am Niki, a self taught digital artist seeing things in a new light, in this great new world. I am a mother of two wonderful children, doing what I love. 
I have studied color theory for twenty years and enjoy showing how we are all connected and also connected to the world around us. To me this is so humbling. 
My love for the abstract work is merging with my love for capturing a mood/emotion in a portrait. I have made truly sorrowful artworks but also ones that I hope fills their audience with joy. 
I am exploring myself as an artist, truly grateful for the opportunities. Never has there been a time in my life where I could learn so much for free. To find my voice, use it, and it can actually be heard and matter. 
The piece I chose to share is titled ""Between the devil and the deep blue sea"". This piece represents truly difficult choices or a trapped and tortured mind dreaming of possibilities but only seeing them through a lens or stuck in thought. The ocean waves are like powerful thoughts and images inside this abstract mind. Not getting to express yourself but capturing the beauty of the dreams within. 
This community of this space and all that it means came as quite a surprise to me. That I am truly grateful for. I wouldnt be here without a great group of people that supported me here. Yet another never have I ever statement. I have never been in such great company. Surrounded by the most brilliant, generous, caring, talented people who are building and supporting one another at the same time.
