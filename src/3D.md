**About**

I am a Colombian architect, 3D artist, and photographer.
â€‹
I  started to explore 3D visuals while studying architecture and I was fascinated with the potential it has, so when I completed my degree I decided to focus on this area. I came to the UK 6 years ago and I am currently working as a 3D artist in an architectural visualisation studio in London.

I recently started to create my own artwork and it has been an amazing experience. My pieces are a mixture of all my passions and they are what I create in my free time when I escape, learn, and experiment.
