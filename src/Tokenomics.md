## Stealth Launch

$LIT was stealth launched on 12/1/2021. 

Half of the supply was sent to [CdM](https://twitter.com/CozomoMedici) and the other half was provided to the [LP](https://info.uniswap.org/#/pools/0x86347ace0fbf4e408c0183622e9c063ca5a2258a) on Uniswap.

On 12/18/2021 Cozomo de' Medici took the decision to fund LITDAO and decentralise the holdings he was curating. [Transaction](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9d8ec9ef552920697ed6e26c0df5c6235c15ad6dee2806d363be469b0ca979d4)

## Staking

A [proposal](https://snapshot.org/#/litdaowtf.eth/proposal/0x593e812949f4ba0daff621224bc12af4ed5281b7db203e658d8b563eb01201bb) was voted between 3/7/2022 and 3/10/2022 to decide 

the staking rewards LITDAO will provide to stakers. 

Option 2 won, which consistes in a Time Incentive/ 10.5% p/a return + 90 day bonus of 4.5% p/a.

Ending in a possible yearly return of 15% on $LIT Token.

Next chapter we will dive deeper into the staking contract and its mechanisms.
