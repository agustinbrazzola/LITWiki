**About**

I currently operate a nonprofit providing martial art and performing arts programs to low income inner city youth and families, as well as women's empowerment self defense and fitness. My organization also produces short films via our stunt performer team, most of which are SAG-AFTR, our team produced the Power Rangers Unworthy production on YouTube. I am personally a martial artist and performance artist utilizing martial arts as my medium of expression.
