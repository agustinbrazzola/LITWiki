**About**

I am no artist just an information lover. I share information freely to foster intellectual growth for as many people as I can for as long as I can remember. My involvements in BTC, ETH and LIT are all just extensions of this mission statement. I do it for myself as much as for others sake. I purposefully leave it quietly unmonetized so that those who cross my path may find it useful in the hopes that they may be more inclined to curiously ask questions that, otherwise, seemed unapproachable. P.S. I also plan to release essays explaining my comics and make them relatable and informational with a bit of humor to keep people engaged. Though I often drew comics when in class, my inspiration for these comical drawings stems from the use of similar comics in the writings of Bitcoin developer and teacher Jimmy Song who has been helping Bitcoiners build their own bitcoin libraries for many years.
